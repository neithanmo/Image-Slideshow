# Image-Slideshow
Slideshow using a raspberry pi - GPU - OpenFrameworks 

This slideshow use shaders for transitions effect, so you only need to upload to the aplication the fragment shader to use.
you can use fragment shaders. I suggest you looking sities like:
http://glsl.io/
http://glslsandbox.com/

the vertex shader is in this repository..and in source, you need to exchange the path to the images folder.
